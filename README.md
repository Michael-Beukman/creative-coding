# creative-coding
A repository for using code to make cool and beautiful things

Some fun peices of javascript code to illustrate the beauty of math, algorithms and nature.

Many of these projects were inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) Youtube channel:
