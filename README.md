# creative-coding
A repository for using code to make cool and beautiful things

Some fun pieces of javascript code to illustrate the beauty of math, algorithms and nature.

Many of these projects were inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) Youtube channel.

Many of these projects are based on some mathematical process or equation, interesting concepts or simply pretty pictures or animations.
